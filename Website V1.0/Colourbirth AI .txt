How would the model be trained? 
- This model could be trained using tagged data 
- Supervised learning approach since the data is qualitative 

e.g. the model won't be able to figure out the colour "jade green" if you tell it that it's close to "dark green" 

The words used to describe colour are very unique - they can't be "figured out" - especially not by the limited neural network i'm building.
